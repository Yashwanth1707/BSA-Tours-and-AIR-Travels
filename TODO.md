# Task: Arrange cards buttons in single alignment and make images same size

## Information Gathered
- Focus on South India and International sections.
- Cards in these sections use horizontal scroll layout.
- Images in tour cards vary in size and aspect ratio, no consistent dimensions.
- Buttons ("More Info") are at the bottom of each card, but due to varying text lengths, they are not aligned horizontally across cards.
- Tour cards do not have fixed height, causing misalignment.

## Plan
- **Standardize image sizes**: Set all images in South India and International cards to consistent width and height (e.g., w-full h-48 object-cover) to maintain aspect ratio and same size.
- **Align buttons**: Add fixed height to tour cards (e.g., h-96), use flexbox (flex flex-col) to structure card content, and push buttons to bottom (mt-auto) for uniform alignment.
- **Apply changes to**: South India (south-india-cards) and International Trips (international-cards) sections.

## Dependent Files
- index.html.html: Main file to edit for card layouts, images, and buttons.

## Followup Steps
- Test the layout on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
- Verify images display correctly with object-cover.
- Check button alignment in horizontal scroll view.
